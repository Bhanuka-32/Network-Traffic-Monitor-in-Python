# Network-Traffic-Monitor-in-Python
A Network Traffic Monitor project lets you track and analyze the data flowing through your network interfaces.

This Python project monitors real-time network data usage by tracking bytes sent and received over the network interface. Using the psutil library, it calculates and displays upload and download speeds every second. It helps users understand their network traffic patterns and can be extended for logging or graphical display.
